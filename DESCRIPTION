Title: Geographic Profiling Methods for Serial Crime Analysis
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Jamie Spaulding and Keith Morris
Maintainer: Jamie Spaulding <jspauldi@mix.wvu.edu>
Description: An implementation of functions for the analysis of serial crime 
    incidents. The package implements algorithms for the geographical profiling 
    of serial incidents in attempt to prioritize the area in which the anchor 
    point or home base of the perpetrator is located. The geographic profiling 
    methods in the package are implemented based upon the 'Dragnet' software 
    by Canter, Coffey, Huntley, and Missen (2000) <doi:10.1023/A:1007551316253>,
    the 'CrimeStat' software by Levine (2013) 
    <https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/crimestat-spatial-statistics-program-analysis-crime-incident-locations>,
    and the criminal geographic targeting model outlined in Rossmo (2000, ISBN:978-0849381294)
    and Rossmo (1995) <http://summit.sfu.ca/item/6820>.
